# Unit-2-Bonus
Easy: [I allowed the player to move forward and backward within a certain range.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvXDN6rBP2vvNQ_krxfZWrnaMmem4ST2/view?usp=sharing)

Medium: [I also revealed animals from the left and right side of the screen. I added it so that when one of these hits the player, the console will say "Game Over".](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Czj_pdeproiWAvDLTFSb4yfsBPnkD19/view?usp=sharing)

Hard: [If the player feeds an animal, I increased the score and showed it. If the player misses or hits an animal, I reduced the player's health and showed this. When the health count reached 0, I entered "Game Over" into the console and destroyed the player.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ldcNlLr8D8CI2dtzAsPHcCIZoHpMmRvi/view?usp=sharing)
